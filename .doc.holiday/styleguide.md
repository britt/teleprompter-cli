# Documentation Style Guide

## Project Summary

Project: teleprompter-cli

Description and purpose
- teleprompter-cli is a TypeScript-based command-line application (CLI) project. The repository contains both CLI source (TSX/TS files) and test suites, and shows use of Ink (React for CLIs) via types and an ink-cli folder. Although no explicit README description is present, the file layout and names indicate this project implements a console teleprompter interface and command set (list, push, import, export, get, rollback, versions) for managing teleprompter content from the terminal.

Audience
- End users who run the CLI (installers, operators).
- Developers who extend/maintain the CLI (TypeScript/Ink engineers, test authors).
- Documentation maintainers producing usage guides, command docs, and API reference generated by TypeDoc.

Content types present / recommended
- Quickstart and Usage guides (README.md / readme.md files).
- Command reference pages (one page per command, e.g., push, list, get) rendered from teleprompter-cli-v2/source/commands/.
- Code examples and snippets embedded inline (TSX/TS fenced blocks).
- Developer guides (tests, types/ folder, ink-cli implementations).
- API documentation generated by TypeDoc from TS source in src/ and teleprompter-cli-v2/source/.

Technical complexity level
- Medium: modern TypeScript, React-ink, TSX components, TypeDoc generation and CLI runtime considerations. Contributors should be comfortable with TypeScript, small React components in Ink, and CLI UX patterns.

Observed writing patterns and conventions
- Single top-level README.md files exist at repo root and under teleprompter-cli-v2/readme.md; these are the primary human-facing docs.
- Example/test files and code snippets are present in tests and source; code blocks use language markers (TS/TSX/JS) in existing examples.
- No metadata/front matter is used currently (front matter usage is absent). There is no Table of Contents in the repository docs.

Key recommendations (high level)
- Adopt a single H1 per document and Title Case for section headings.
- Maintain one canonical README or documentation landing page and a docs/ directory that holds authored pages (command docs, guides). Use TypeDoc to generate API pages into docs/api/.
- Add a minimal front matter for pages that will be included in a static site builder if needed; TypeDoc itself does not require front matter, but static site integrations (e.g., Docusaurus) do.
- Keep each command documented in its own file: Overview, Usage, Options, Examples, Exit codes, and Related commands.

Examples of content found (representative)
- Command file names: teleprompter-cli-v2/source/commands/list.tsx, push.tsx, import.tsx
- Top-level launchers: teleprompter-cli-v2/source/cli.tsx, app.tsx
- Test files demonstrating usage and examples: src/__tests__/sample.test.ts, ink-cli/__tests__/list.test.tsx



## Context

**Project:** teleprompter-cli
**Description:** No description available
**Publishing System:** TypeDoc

## Primary Documentation Goals

## Writing Rules

### Core Principles
- **Be concise** - Use the minimum words necessary
- **Be practical** - Focus on actionable information
- **Be example-driven** - Show working code for every concept
- **Be consistent** - Match existing documentation patterns

### Tone Guidelines

#### Default Tone (Technical Users)
- Direct and practical language
- Assume familiarity with TypeScript, package managers, CLI
- Use technical jargon and shorthand
- Focus on code examples over explanations
- Avoid marketing language or benefit statements

#### Non-Technical User Adjustments
When explicitly writing for non-technical users:
- Explain what each command does and why
- Spell out abbreviations and technical terms
- Provide simpler code examples with explanations
- Include more step-by-step guidance
- Link to additional learning resources

### Publishing System Requirements
TypeDoc-specific guidance and publishing requirements

About TypeDoc
- TypeDoc generates API documentation from TypeScript source code comments and signatures. It produces static HTML (via its default theme) or JSON. TypeDoc itself does not require front matter in source files. However, if you integrate TypeDoc output into a static documentation site (Docusaurus, Hugo, or other SSG), those pages may require front matter.

Required metadata fields (recommended for pages that will be used by a site generator)
- title: Short, unique page title (string)
- description: One-sentence summary for search/meta (string)
- slug or permalink: Absolute or site-root relative URL for the page (string)
- sidebar_label: Short label used in sidebar navigation (string)
Note: TypeDoc output (API pages) is not annotated with front matter by default. If you want consistent page metadata across authored markdown files, include front matter in those markdown files. For generated API pages, configure the site generator to create metadata or post-process TypeDoc output.

Exact front matter template to use for authored markdown pages
- Use the exact template below for every authored markdown doc (put at top of each .md file):

---
title: "<Page Title>"
description: "<One-line description of this page for search/meta. Keep < 160 chars.>"
slug: "/docs/<path-to-page>/"
sidebar_label: "<Short Label>"
---

Replace bracketed values. Example:

---
title: "teleprompter-cli — Usage"
description: "How to install and run teleprompter-cli and a summary of commands."
slug: "/docs/teleprompter/usage/"
sidebar_label: "Usage"
---

Notes:
- If your publishing pipeline does not require front matter, the lines above are harmless but optional. If you are using a static site generator, include the exact fields required by that generator (some SSGs require layout or category fields).

TypeDoc configuration (typedoc.json) example
- A TypeDoc config file should live at the repository root named typedoc.json. Minimal recommended configuration:

{
  "entryPoints": ["src/index.ts", "teleprompter-cli-v2/source/index.tsx"],
  "out": "docs/api",
  "name": "teleprompter-cli API",
  "includeVersion": true,
  "tsconfig": "tsconfig.json",
  "exclude": ["**/__tests__/**", "**/*.test.tsx", "**/*.spec.ts"],
  "plugin": ["typedoc-plugin-markdown"]
}

- Comments:
  - entryPoints: list the top-level modules to include in the API.
  - out: use docs/api so site and authored docs live under docs/ and can be published together.
  - plugin typedoc-plugin-markdown is recommended if you want Markdown output (useful for integrating generated docs into a markdown-based site). If you prefer HTML, use the default HTML theme and set out to docs/api-html.

How to author textual content to work with TypeDoc and site publishing
- Keep manually authored pages in docs/ (not at project root), using the front matter template above. For example: docs/overview.md, docs/commands/list.md, docs/commands/push.md.
- Keep autodoc/API output under docs/api/ so site builders can incorporate it into navigation.
- Use TypeDoc to generate API docs as part of CI and commit the results to a docs/typedoc/ or push them to the website hosting branch as needed.

Code examples formatting
- Use fenced code blocks with language tag. For TypeScript source examples use triple-backticks with ts or tsx.
Example:

```ts
import { runTeleprompter } from "teleprompter-cli";

runTeleprompter({ file: "script.txt", speed: 120 });
```

- For shell/CLI examples use sh or bash and prefix single-line examples with $ for clarity:

```bash
$ teleprompter list --remote
```

- For short inline code elements, use single backticks: `teleprompter push`.

Publishing checklist
- Ensure docs/ contains authored pages with front matter template.
- typedoc.json exists and is configured as above.
- CI step: typedoc --options typedoc.json to regenerate docs/api/ during releases.
- If using a site generator, add navigation entries to the site config pointing to docs/ and docs/api/ pages.


### Content Structure Rules
Content organization guidelines for this project

General principles
- Every page begins with a short summary (1-2 sentences) explaining the page’s purpose.
- Use the front matter template at the top of authored pages.
- Keep pages focused: one concept per page for commands or one per major developer topic.
- Include a consistent 'Examples' subsection wherever usage is shown.
- Code examples and CLI usage must come with expected outputs where appropriate.

Technical Documentation Pages (Commands / API / Usage)
- Structure for a command page (commands/<command>.md):
  1. H1: Command name and short description
  2. Short summary paragraph (what the command does)
  3. Installation / availability (if not obvious)
  4. Usage (code block with minimal invocation)
  5. Options (table or bullet list of flags and descriptions)
  6. Examples (one or more runnable examples with expected output)
  7. Exit codes / Errors (if applicable)
  8. See also / Related commands (links to other command pages)

- Example command doc skeleton:
  # list — Show available teleprompter scripts
  A short description.

  ## Usage
  ```bash
  $ teleprompter list [--remote | -r]
  ```

  ## Options
  - `--remote, -r` — List scripts from the remote store.

  ## Examples
  ```bash
  $ teleprompter list
  script-1.txt
  script-2.txt
  ```

Developer / Process Documentation Pages
- Start with prerequisites (node version, OS constraints, env vars).
- Provide a step-by-step runbook for local development and testing:
  - Install dev dependencies (npm ci or yarn)
  - Build steps (tsc / tsc --build)
  - Run tests (npm test)
  - Generate docs (npm run docs -> typedoc)
- Include an architecture section with a brief description and a diagram (ASCII, link to image, or embedded SVG).

API Reference (TypeDoc-generated)
- Don't hand-edit generated files. Add an index page /docs/api/README.md that links to generated API pages.
- In authored API overview pages, include quick examples for primary exported functions or components and link to the generated symbol pages.

Formatting conventions
- Fenced code blocks with language tags (ts, tsx, bash).
- Inline code with single backticks for commands and short code items.
- Use bullet lists for options and simple lists; use numbered lists for sequential procedures.
- Keep line length sensible (wrap at ~100 characters for markdown readability).

Accessibility and readability
- Use plain language; avoid jargon unless required.
- Use short paragraphs and prefatory sentences for long code examples.


#### Heading Rules
```markdown
Heading style and hierarchy (use exactly one H1 per file)

H1 (Single per file)
- Use exactly one H1 at the top of each document as the document title. Title Case preferred for H1s.
- No trailing punctuation (no period) or decorative characters.
- Examples (recommended):
  # teleprompter-cli
  # Usage
  # Commands: list

H2 (Major sections)
- Use for the main sections within a document, in Title Case.
- Typical H2s: Installation, Quickstart, Usage, Commands, Options, Examples, Configuration, Troubleshooting, Developer Guide, API Reference
- Examples:
  ## Quickstart
  ## Commands
  ## Examples

H3 (Subsections)
- Use for subsections that break down major sections: specific command options, example variants, or step subsections.
- Example:
  ### list
  ### Options
  ### Example: push a script from file

H4 (Rare usage)
- Reserved for fine-grained technical details or very long pages where multiple nested lists or notes are needed (e.g., Data Formats, Exit Codes).
- Example:
  #### Exit Codes and Meanings

Formatting and casing rules
- H1 and H2: Title Case (capitalize main words).
- H3 and deeper: Title Case for short headings; Sentence case is acceptable for descriptive subheadings.
- Use consistent spacing: one blank line before and after headings.
- Use a single blank line between paragraphs and code blocks.

Examples from the codebase (recommended standardized versions)
- # teleprompter-cli
- ## Commands
- ### list
- ## Quickstart
- ## Developer Guide

```

### Formatting Requirements

#### Lists

- Use bullets for unordered lists
- No periods at end of list items
- Use Oxford comma in series

### Code Example Requirements

1. Always include syntax highlighting with language tags
2. Always include a language tag when adding a code block
3. Show both input and expected output
4. Include comments for complex logic
5. Place runnable example near page top
6. Use codetabs for platform variants

### Linking Rules
Linking strategy and standards

Internal links (recommended)
- Prefer absolute paths relative to site root when the docs will be published under a documentation site.
  - Example: [Commands](/docs/commands/list)
- If you author files within the repository and do not have a site root configured, use relative links between markdown files.
  - Example: [Usage](./usage.md) or [list command](../commands/list.md)
- For linking to generated TypeDoc API pages, link to the output path under docs/api. Example:
  - Example: [API: runTeleprompter](/docs/api/modules.md#runteleprompter) or link to the symbol name if your TypeDoc Markdown plugin creates named files: [runTeleprompter](./api/modules/teleprompter.md#runTeleprompter)

External links
- Always use full URLs and name the external target for clarity.
  - Example: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- For external references to libraries used (Ink, TypeDoc) include the project name and a short reason why it’s linked.
  - Example: [Ink (React for CLIs)](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) — used for CLI UI rendering.

Cross-reference and navigation standards
- Use descriptive link text instead of raw URLs. Prefer semantic phrases: "See the list command" rather than "click here".
- When referring to another page in repository docs, link to the canonical docs path (docs/commands/...). Maintain a mapping in the docs site config to ensure sidebar links remain stable.
- Link maintenance:
  - Keep links relative where pages move together to reduce breakage.
  - Use CI link checkers (e.g., markdown-link-check) as part of the docs pipeline.
  - When moving or renaming documents, add a short note and redirect on the previous page if the site generator supports redirects.

Exact syntax examples
- Relative doc link (same folder): [Quickstart](./quickstart.md)
- Relative doc link (parent folder): [Commands](../commands/list.md)
- Absolute site link (recommended for published site): [List command](/docs/commands/list)
- External link: [TypeDoc (official)](https://typedoc.org/)

When to use each approach
- Use absolute site links when you are authoring pages for a published documentation site and the site root is stable.
- Use relative links if authors are editing raw markdown files in the repo and you expect files to move together or be consumed directly.

Validation
- Add a CI step to run a markdown link checker against the docs/ directory. Fail the build on broken links.


### Documentation Content Examples

## Existing Documentation Directory Structure
Current repository layout and recommended content mapping

Top-level (repo root)
- README.md: Primary project landing page (short overview, quickstart and pointers to docs/). There are duplicate README.md files at root; consolidate so one README is authoritative.
- AGENTS.md: Keep as-is if it documents agent-related behaviors; move into docs/process/ if it is process documentation.
- LICENSE: Keep at repo root.

teleprompter-cli-v2/
- readme.md: Document v2 features and migration notes. Rename to README.md or consolidate with root readme to avoid confusion. Recommended: move authored content into docs/v2/ and keep source/ for code.
- source/: Primary v2 source code that powers CLI. Files observed:
  - cli.tsx — CLI entry point and argument parsing
  - app.tsx — Ink components and app composition
  - util.tsx — shared utilities
  - commands/ — each command implemented as a module: list.tsx, push.tsx, import.tsx, export.tsx, get.tsx, rollback.tsx, versions.tsx, index.tsx

types/
- ink.d.ts, ink-testing-library.d.ts, dist-index.d.ts: Type definition files for dependencies and distributions. Keep under types/ for clarity. If published, ensure types are aligned with package.json "types" field.

src/
- index.ts: Primary library entry — export public API used by internal CLI or external consumers.
- __tests__/: Unit tests for src/ codebase (sample.test.ts)

ink-cli/
- index.tsx: Ink-based CLI code (likely a variant or helper). Keep here for separation of CLI UI components from core logic.
- __tests__/: Tests for CLI UI behavior (list.test.tsx)

Recommended documentation directories (new organization)
- docs/
  - overview.md (project overview and goals)
  - quickstart.md (install and run examples)
  - commands/
    - list.md
    - push.md
    - import.md
    - export.md
    - get.md
    - rollback.md
    - versions.md
  - dev/
    - contributing.md
    - testing.md
    - architecture.md (component map: CLI, app, util, commands)
  - api/ (generated TypeDoc output or a collapsed index pointing to generated files)

Mapping rules
- Keep source code under teleprompter-cli-v2/source/ and src/.
- Move authored markdown files into docs/ and add the front matter template to each.
- Keep generated API docs in docs/api/ (ignored by default in .gitignore if you regenerate in CI) unless you prefer to check in generated docs.
